            External styles refers to creating a separate file that contains all style information. This file is then linked to from as 
            many HTML pages as you like â€” even the whole site.To add an external stylesheet to a web page, use the <link> tag, providing
             the URL of the style sheet in the href attribute, as well as rel="stylesheet".
             
             For the following example, I've taken the styles from the above (embedded) 
             example, moved them to an external style sheet, then linked to that file.
