        <!-- There is a special tag for specifying headings in HTML. 
            There are 6 levels of headings in HTML ranging from <h1> 
            for the most important, to <h6> for the least important. -->
        <p> Heading Formats</p>
        <h1>Big and Important Header</h1>
        <h2>Slightly Less Big Header</h2>
        <h3>Sub-Header</h3>
        <h4>This is header 4</h4>
        <h5>Finally, There is one last</h5>
        <h6>I'm the last heading</h6>
    
        
        <!-- To place a strong importance on a piece of text, use the <strong> element. -->
        <p><strong>Attention:</strong> Please leave the door open.</p>


        <!-- You can place an emphasis on text by using the <em> element. -->
        <p>Strawberries are absolutely <em>delicious</em>!</p>

       
        <!--  You can force a line break by using the <br> element. -->
        <p>Here is a <br>line break.</p>

        <!-- You can create a paragraph-level thematic break by using the <hr> element. 
            Therefore, this element allows you to separate different topics into logical groups.
            
            In early versions of HTML, this element represented a "horizontal rule". 
            However, HTML5 gave it a specific semantic meaning (it represents a paragraph-level
             thematic break). -->
